# MachineLearning Homework Readme

This repository contains code for five different machine learning homework assignments completed by Calicia Perea. Each assignment is described briefly below.

## HW1

In HW1, the iris dataset is used to practice reading in data from a file and using pandas to manipulate it. The file containing the dataset is renamed to "iris.data.csv" to allow for easy file path usage in the document.

## HW2

HW2 uses Google Colab to read in csv files and print out three different data sets using the Iris and Adult names data. The program outputs the perceptron, Adeline, and SGD graph printouts.

## HW3

This project uses the sklearn library to learn different classification models and report the models' performance on testing and training data. It requires using Google Colab to run the "[hw3.py](http://hw3.py/)" file. The output includes the adjusted hyper-parameters and their performance, and the testing time.

## HW4

HW4 compares the performance of three dimensionality reduction techniques - PCA, LDA, and KernelPCA - on the Iris and MNIST datasets using a decision tree classifier. The output includes the accuracy of each method, the fitting time of each method, and the modifications made to improve the accuracies.

## HW5

HW5 performs linear regression analysis on the California housing dataset using scikit-learn library. Five regression functions are used: LinearRegression, RANSACRegressor, Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet. The output includes the mean squared error (MSE), R2 score, scatterplot, and fit time for each regression function on the dataset.

All code is written in Python and requires the following libraries to be installed:

-   scikit-learn
-   numpy
-   matplotlib

To run the code, execute the script in a Python environment with the required libraries installed.
