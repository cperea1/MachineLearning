### Datasets

This project uses three datasets. These data sets must be stored with the scripts in order for them to load properly. 

- AB_US_2020.csv
- AB_NYC_2019.csv
- AB_CH_2021.csv

### Scripts

This project has four scripts 

- main.py : This is the main script that you will need to run in order to obtain all the final work and analysis. The code has been arrange in order of operation to run successfully.

- preprocessing.py : This code provides functions to load, clean , split and standardize the data. This code does not need to be run but successfully imported into the main code.

- machine_learning.py : This code provides functions to perform all model fitting, testing and time recording. This code does not need to be run but successfully imported into the main code.

- data_vis.py : This code provides functions to display eda, data exploration, model results, feature importance and other visual products that we used to analyize the data. This code does not need to be run but successfully imported into the main code.

#### Instructions

Please load the outlined packages and import the additional scripts before running the main. py. 

Main.py does take in excess of 2.5 hours to run please be patient.
